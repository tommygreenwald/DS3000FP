    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding startups is not difficult, but finding great startups is an extremely challenging task. There's the famously thrown around statistic which states that 9 out of 10 startups will fail. While it’s debated how much validity there is to that statement, one thing is for sure, operating a successful startup is HARD. Startups require lots of money to get off the ground and get moving, but investing money in businesses where most fail is a very risky endeavor. This is usually the onus of angel investors and venture capital (VC) firms, who frequently invest in early stage startups. To make this sort of risky investment requires a lot of effort to source potential winners, and conduct due diligence on them to evaluate the opportunity. We want to help make sourcing startups and evaluating them easier and more intelligent, by creating an assortment of machine learning classifiers and predictors. These classifiers will help group potential startups by their market and product fit, and evaluate them based on common traits of those groups. We seek to be able to predict quantifiable attributes of successful startups, like the potential for capital investments. At the end of the day, we want to learn what makes a winner, or even better, a unicorn. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Without startups, we would not have companies pushing the boundaries of technology and innovation. We would have no AirBnB, no Instagram, no Uber, no SpaceX, no Tesla. Startups are where new ideas are born, new industries are created, and new markets that we didn’t even know existed yet. Fostering this sort of innovative ecosystem that drives the world forward is an extremely important, not to mention profitable, endeavor. Oftentimes angels and VC firms can make hundreds of times their investment if the company ends up with a big valuation, creating lots of financial incentive to intelligently source startups. In addition, sourcing is mostly a manual process right now, researching startups on newsletters, going to conferences, reaching out to founders on LinkedIn. If there was a tool that helped automate a lot of this work, and narrow down the amount of companies that needed due diligence, it would be a tremendous help to angels and VCs. Oftentimes there will be thousands of potential startups that angels and VCs need to group and explore, and it takes hours and hours of human labor. With our classifiers and predictors it will cut this time down tremendously, allowing them to focus on what matters, the winners. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions/Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can we use various metrics such as market, region, founding month, etc. to predict how much total funding a startup will raise?\n",
    " \n",
    "- Can we use linear regression and the aforementioned metrics to make a prediction on funding?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we determine whether Ridge or Lasso regularization will result in a better linear regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- H0: The 11 feature variables (market, country_code, region, funding_rounds, founded_month, founded_quarter, founded_year, seed, venture, round_a, round_b) will NOT have an effect on predicting the total funding amount a startup raises. \n",

    "The IVs are the 11 feature varibles which include market, country_code, region, funding_rounds, founded_month, founded_quarter, founded_year, seed, venture, round_a, and round_b. These IVs try to predict the DV of total funding. We chose these variables as predictors because they intuitively seemed to be the most directly correlated with total funding for a startup based on our prior knowledge of venture capital funding. This is a supervised ML problem because we are trying to use these labeled feature variables to *predict* a continuous target variable. Thus, the learning task is a regression problem. We are going to use linear regression with both LASSO (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization. We are also going to try kNN regression as well as an SVM regression. We felt that these 3 algorithms, with different types of regularization included, will allow us to get a full picture of the data and account for any patterns in the distribution of the data that may cause one model or regularization to perform better than the others.
